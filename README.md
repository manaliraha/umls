# Getting Started - Introduction

* Unified Medical Language System consists of some data obtained from different biomedical source vocabularies such as MeSH, SNOMED-CT, ICD10 etc. 
* The data can be downloaded from metathesaurus download link available in [2021AA UMLS Metathesaurus Files](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html)
* There is a book describing the data grouping and overall concepts and structuring used for the metathesaurus in the [UMLSÂ® Reference Manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9685/)

### Local development

* Download the data files
* Install mysql on local and run the db scripts (some modifications in the scripts are required and are committed as part of this repository)
* Need to set some env variables specific to the running mysql and run the service in the following fashion -

```
mvn clean install
java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
